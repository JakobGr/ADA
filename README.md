- **`nslt_100.json`**: Annotation file mapping videos to their corresponding labels and subsets (train, validation, test).
- **`TimeSformer.ipynb`**: Notebook implementing the TimeSformer model for ASL recognition.
- **`VideoMAE.ipynb`**: Initial implementation of VideoMAE for ASL recognition.
- **`VideoMAE_correct_split.ipynb`**: Corrected implementation of VideoMAE with proper dataset splits.
- **`VideoMAE_correct_split.pth`**: Pretrained weights for the corrected VideoMAE implementation.
- **`.gitattributes`**: Configuration for handling large files in GitHub.

Other trained models and configurations are available upon request.
